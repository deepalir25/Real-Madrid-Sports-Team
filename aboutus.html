    <img src="images/Deepali.jpg" alt="Deepali Rajput" class="about-photo">
    <p>My name is Deepali Rajput. I am a dual degree master's student in Artificial Intelligence & Business Analytics, and Marketing at the Muma College of Business, University of South Florida.</p>
    
    <p>I am currently working as a Business Analyst Intern at Raymond James this summer. I enjoyed creating this website and it was a valuable experience for me. I got to apply the concepts I have been learning in class into something practical and creative.</p>
    
    <p>This website was developed as a part of our user interface assignment. I used HTML for structuring the pages, CSS to design and style them, and JavaScript for adding interactivity. For the data visualization part, I used Chart.js, which helped me display some interesting stats about Real Madrid's performance over the years.</p>
    
    <p>Through this project, I not only practiced front-end development but also learned how to plan content, organize code, and simulate data interaction in a simple and user-friendly way. It gave me more confidence in working with web technologies and creating data-driven interfaces.</p>
